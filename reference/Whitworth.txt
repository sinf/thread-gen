The form of a Whitworth thread is based on a fundamental triangle with an angle of 55° at each peak and valley. The sides are at a flank angle of Θ = 27.5° perpendicular to the axis. Thus, if the thread pitch is p, the height of the fundamental triangle is H = p/(2 tan Θ) = 0.96049106 p. However, the top and bottom ​1⁄6 of each of these triangles is cut off, so the actual depth of thread (the difference between major and minor diameters) is ​2⁄3 of that value, or h = p/(3 tan Θ) = 0.64032738 p. The peaks are further reduced by rounding them with a 2×(90° − Θ) = 180° − 55° = 125° circular arc. This arc has a height of e = H sin Θ/6 = 0.073917569 p (leaving a straight flank depth of h − 2e = 0.49249224 p) and a radius of r = e/(1 − sin Θ) = 0.13732908 p.
